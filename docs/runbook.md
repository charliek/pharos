# Service Migration Runbook (Pharos + Limen)

**The operational procedure for taking a single HTTP service from a legacy implementation to a new one, safely and with AI assistance, using the Pharos functional test suite and the Limen migration proxy.**

---

## 0. About This Document

This runbook is written for two readers at once:

- **Engineers** performing a migration, who need a concrete, ordered procedure with commands, decision points, and go/no-go gates.
- **Claude Code (or another coding agent)**, which uses this document — together with a target service's source code and OpenAPI/Swagger definition — to generate the migration artifacts (behavioral contract, Pharos scenarios) and to drive the iteration loop. The structure (inputs → actions → outputs at each step) is designed so this runbook can seed a reusable skill.

It assumes familiarity with two companion specifications:

- **Pharos** — black-box functional test suite (TypeScript/Vitest). Validates new vs. legacy deterministically; refines the behavioral contract.
- **Limen** — migration proxy (Rust). Routes live traffic, shadows reads, compares responses, rolls out by percentage, fails back to legacy.

Both consume the **same shared behavioral contract**, in the same vocabulary and the same JSONPath subset, so a contract file is portable between them unchanged.

### 0.1 The assumed migration pattern

This runbook assumes the **most common and lowest-risk** migration shape:

- **Shared datastore.** Legacy and new read and write the **same** backing store. The migration is a **re-implementation of request-handling logic** (e.g. moving off an older framework), not a data migration. A write through either implementation is immediately visible to the other.
- **Behavioral parity over shared data** is therefore the whole correctness question: *given the same stored data and the same request, does the new implementation return what legacy returns?* The contract expresses exactly this.

Where a migration does **not** share a datastore (separate stores that must be kept in sync), the consistency problem is fundamentally harder and edges toward dual-write territory, which both tools treat as out of scope. Section 7.4 flags the cautions; treat that as the exception, not the path.

### 0.2 The per-service lifecycle

```
  1. DISCOVER     → inventory routes, classify read/write, risk-tag
  1b. OBSERVE     → relay real traffic through Limen; suggest-routes proposes a
                    per-route disposition from the profile
  2. DRAFT        → AI proposes a behavioral contract from code + OpenAPI + samples
  3. GENERATE     → AI writes Pharos scenarios (success / error / edge) per route
  4. REVIEW (gate)→ human validates contract + scenarios before they are trusted
  5. REFINE       → run Pharos; converge contract and new-service behavior to green
  6. SHADOW       → wire route into Limen shadow_legacy_primary; watch parity + budgets
  7. ROLL OUT     → raise percentage 0→1→5→25→100, with a gate between each step
  8. CUT OVER     → new_only or keep failover; Pharos remains as regression
```

Each stage below states its **inputs**, **actions**, and **outputs**, with decision gates called out explicitly.

---

## 1. Stage 1 — Discover

**Goal:** produce a complete, classified inventory of the service's routes and the risk profile of each.

**Inputs:**
- The legacy service source code.
- The OpenAPI/Swagger definition (if present).
- Optionally, captured production traffic or access logs (for real-world payload shapes and traffic distribution).

**Actions:**
1. **Enumerate routes.** From the OpenAPI paths and/or the legacy router/controller code, list every `(method, path_template)` the service exposes.
2. **Classify each route** along three axes:
   - **Read vs. write.** GET/HEAD are reads. POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE are writes. (A POST used only for complex queries is a *logical read* — note it; it may be safely shadowable, see Section 6.5.)
   - **Idempotency.** Is repeating the request safe? GET/HEAD/PUT/DELETE are typically idempotent; POST typically is not. This determines failover and replay eligibility.
   - **Risk.** Low (pure read, stable shape), medium (read with complex/derived fields, or idempotent write), high (non-idempotent write, money/auth/permissions, side effects beyond the shared store such as emails or third-party calls).
3. **Identify side effects beyond the datastore.** Any route that sends email, calls a third party, enqueues jobs, or charges money cannot be naively shadowed even if it's a "read" in HTTP terms. Mark these `has-external-side-effects`.
4. **Capture representative payloads.** For each route, collect a few real request/response examples (from OpenAPI examples, tests, or captured traffic). These drive contract drafting.

**Outputs:**
- A **route inventory table**: `id`, `method`, `path_template`, read/write, idempotent?, risk, side-effects, sample payloads.
- A migration **ordering**: low-risk reads first, then idempotent writes, then high-risk writes last.

The inventory is a set of *claims* about routes, and the most dangerous of them — "this `GET` has no side effect" — is the one code reading is most likely to get wrong on a large surface. Stage 1b checks those claims against the service's real traffic before any of them is trusted.

**For the agent:** when reading OpenAPI, treat `paths.*.responses.*.content.application/json.schema` as the authority on response shape, and `examples`/`example` as the authority on concrete values. When reading legacy code, find the router/controller layer to enumerate routes and the serialization layer to find dynamic fields (timestamps, generated IDs, request IDs).

---

## 1b. Stage 1b — Observe (let real traffic name the risky routes)

**Goal:** replace the riskiest guesses in the Stage 1 inventory with evidence from the service's own traffic, and reach a *disposition* per route — may this route be compared at all, and if so, comparing what — before a single shadow request is ever dispatched.

Run this stage whenever a legacy service is reachable and can be driven with representative traffic. It is cheap (Limen relays, it does not shadow) and safe (nothing is sent to `new`; a `new` upstream need not exist yet), and it catches the mis-tagged routes that *announce* themselves — a read that redirects, mints a cookie, or carries a one-time token in its query.

Be precise about what it does not catch. A mutating read with innocuous metadata is invisible to it: `GET /orders/42/mark-read` answering a stable `200` JSON looks exactly like `GET /orders/42` from the outside, and the classifier suggests it as a `compare_candidate` — the tool's own test suite asserts that limitation rather than hiding it. Reading the handler's source is what catches that one, which is why step 6 below is not optional.

**Inputs:**
- Limen in front of the legacy service with the Stage 1 inventory expressed as its route table — `mode: legacy_only` is enough.
- Representative traffic (a driving harness, replayed production shapes, or real traffic if Limen is already on the path).
- The two doctrine pages this stage orchestrates: [observe mode](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/observe-mode/) for the mechanism, [classifying routes](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/classifying-routes/) for the judgment.

**Actions:**

1. **Bind the control plane to loopback, then turn the `observe:` block on.** The profile discloses route topology and query-parameter *names*, so `metrics.listen_addr` must not be `0.0.0.0` anywhere but a laptop. Presence of the block is the whole switch — `observe: {}` is a complete, valid block, and `limen run` logs a loud warning whenever it is present. Field-by-field: [observe mode → turn the block on](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/observe-mode/#1-turn-the-block-on).
2. **Drive traffic at `sample_rate: 1.0`.** Coverage, not volume, is what this stage buys: the classifier's dangerous rules are *existential*, so a corpus that never exercises a route's redirect or flow-hop paths says nothing about them however many times it hits the happy path. Sampling below `1.0` and classification are mutually exclusive — a sampled profile is refused classification outright, not classified with lower confidence.
3. **Read the profile.**
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9090/observe/profile | jq .
   ```
   Every *configured* route appears from the first request onward, zero-filled until observed — a route with `"observations": 0` is telling you your corpus never touched it, which is itself a Stage 1b finding.
4. **Draft, and validate the draft.**
   ```bash
   limen suggest-routes -c limen.config.yaml --new-upstream https://new.internal \
     > draft.limen.config.yaml
   limen validate-config -c draft.limen.config.yaml
   ```
   `suggest-routes` polls until the profile stops changing **and** `limen_in_flight_requests` reads zero — never a blind sleep — then classifies every configured route and emits a complete, loadable config. `--format json` gives the same classification as a machine surface. Options and exit codes: [CLI → `suggest-routes`](https://charliek.github.io/limen/reference/cli/#suggest-routes).
5. **Disposition each route against the class taxonomy.** The tool's three dispositions are evidence, not answers; map each one onto the taxonomy in [classifying routes](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/classifying-routes/#the-class-taxonomy) and record the class in the inventory:

   | Disposition | What it means | Where it lands in the taxonomy |
   |---|---|---|
   | `relay_only` | A danger signal fired (a redirecting read, a cookie-minting read, a one-time-token query name, a catch-all or wildcard-granularity route), or too little was observed to say anything at all. | Classes **C**, **D**, **F** — never compared, by policy — or "not yet known", which is not the same thing and must not be recorded as if it were. |
   | `compare_narrowed` | Nothing dangerous fired, but the body cannot be trusted for equality (varying length, more than one content type, incomplete stability evidence). | Class **B** — compare with narrowed equality; the narrowing becomes contract work in Stage 2. |
   | `compare_candidate` | A request fingerprint repeated with a stable length and no danger signal fired. | Class **A** *if* the source agrees — a hypothesis carrying evidence, never a safety claim. |

6. **Confirm candidates against the source, then adopt deliberately.** The default draft emits `comparison: { enabled: false }` for *every* route, suggestion riding as a comment. That is not a hedge: response metadata can prove a route unsafe to compare and can never prove one safe, so no traffic shape may cause the tool to emit a shadowing config. `--adopt-suggestions` is the human act that promotes suggestions into the shadowing form — pass it only after reading each candidate route's handler.

**Outputs:**
- A per-route **disposition + evidence** merged into the Stage 1 inventory, with a class assigned to every route.
- A validated `draft.limen.config.yaml` — the starting point for the Stage 6 config.
- Two explicit lists that shape everything downstream: the routes that will need narrowing (feeding contract drafting in Stage 2), and the routes that will **never** be compared (which need no scenarios beyond `new_only_assert`, per Section 6).

**Gate:** `suggest-routes` exits `0` when a draft was emitted on real classifications; `20` when nothing was usefully profiled (no observations, every route below the read floor, or a sampled profile); `40` when the profile never quiesced; `50` when a required input was unavailable. **Exit `20` still writes a draft** — the document goes to stdout either way — so the presence of a file proves nothing. What `20` says is that the draft rests on refusals to classify rather than on evidence, which makes it unadoptable, not absent. Automation must branch on the exit code, never on whether the redirect produced output.

**What this stage cannot do.** Observation is per *route*; mutation is per *path*. A route matching a prefix folds every path underneath it into one profile, and the recorder deliberately stores path *hashes*, so no rule can see the fold happening — [sub-path aliasing](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/classifying-routes/#what-observation-can-and-cannot-tell-you) is unfixable from traffic and is the strongest argument for keeping route granularity a human decision. Stage 1b narrows where a human has to look. It does not replace the looking.

**For the agent:** treat `compare_candidate` as a hypothesis to check against the handler's source, never as a result. Never pass `--adopt-suggestions` on the strength of a profile alone, and never widen a route's `path_prefix` to make more traffic land in one classification — that is the wildcard-granularity sharp edge, manufactured on purpose.

---

## 2. Stage 2 — Draft the Behavioral Contract

**Goal:** an AI-drafted contract that captures, per route, what to compare and which dynamic fields to normalize — expressed in the shared vocabulary.

**Inputs:** the route inventory and sample payloads from Stage 1; the OpenAPI schemas; the legacy serialization code.

**Actions — derive each contract element from observable signals:**

Use the **cross-framework difference catalog** (Section 9) as the lookup table. For each route, walk the response shape and decide, field by field:

1. **Is this field dynamic and non-meaningful?** (request IDs, trace IDs, server-generated timestamps that reflect "now", generated resource IDs when the test doesn't pin them) → add to `ignore_paths`.
2. **Is this field sensitive?** (tokens, emails, secrets, anything that must not appear in a log or diff) → add to `redact_paths`.
3. **Is this an array whose order is not contractually guaranteed?** → `sort_arrays` (by a stable key) if order is incidental but elements are identified, or `unordered_arrays` if it's a true set.
4. **Is this a timestamp whose precision or format may differ between frameworks?** (millis vs. seconds, `Z` vs. `+00:00`) → `normalize_timestamps` at the coarsest precision both can satisfy.
5. **Is this an enum whose spelling/casing differs between implementations but means the same thing?** → `enum_aliases`.
6. **Everything else is a real assertion.** Do **not** normalize it. The default posture is *compare everything*; each normalization rule is a deliberate, justified exception.

Set `compare_status: true` and `compare_body: true` by default. Leave `compare_headers: []` unless a specific header is part of the contract (e.g. `content-type`, `location` on creates).

Record **expectations and intentional changes** in the contract's per-route `expectations.notes`: if the new service is *meant* to differ from legacy (a bug fix, a new field, a changed status), say so here and tag the corresponding scenario `intentional-change` so reviewers know the difference is intended.

**Outputs:** a `*.contract.yaml` file (service `defaults` + per-route `comparison` overrides), validated with `check-contract` in either tool.

**Discipline — the over-normalization trap:** every entry in `ignore_paths`/`unordered_arrays`/etc. is a place where a real regression could hide. Keep paths **narrow** (`$.device.lastSeenAt`, not `$.device`), and attach a reason in a comment or in `expectations.notes`. Stage 5 (Refine) exists largely to catch rules that are too broad.

**For the agent:** prefer the **smallest** contract that makes legitimate dynamic differences disappear. When uncertain whether a field is dynamic-noise or meaningful, **leave it as a real assertion** and let Stage 5 reveal it — a false failure you investigate is safer than a real difference you silently ignored.

---

## 3. Stage 3 — Generate Pharos Scenarios

**Goal:** an executable scenario set per route covering success, error, and edge behavior, referencing the contract for normalization.

**Inputs:** the route inventory; the drafted contract; OpenAPI response definitions (which enumerate status codes and error shapes).

**Actions — for each route, generate the standard scenario family:**

1. **Success (happy path).** The primary 2xx case. `mode: compare_live`, `strategy: json_semantic`, `contract` reference for normalization.
2. **Not-found / missing resource.** The 404 (or equivalent) case for a resource that doesn't exist.
3. **Validation / bad input.** The 4xx case(s) the OpenAPI defines (missing field, bad type, out-of-range). Compare the error envelope shape, not just the status.
4. **Authorization / permission** (if the route is authenticated). The 401/403 cases.
5. **Edge cases by shape:**
   - List endpoints → **empty list**, **single item**, **many items** (exercises array sorting/ordering rules).
   - Endpoints with optional fields → **present** and **absent** variants (exercises null-vs-absent handling).
   - Pagination → first page, middle page, past-the-end.
6. **Multi-step flows** where behavior spans requests (create → read-back, see Section 6). Mark destructive flows `destructive` with a `safety` block and `cleanup` hooks.

**How to decide what each scenario asserts:**
- The **status** comes from the OpenAPI response definition.
- The **body assertions** are "everything in the response except what the contract normalizes."
- For error cases, assert the **error code and message shape** via `subset` or `explicit_expectations` — error envelopes are a common cross-framework difference (Section 9), so be precise about what's contractual.

**Tagging:** every scenario gets tags. At minimum `read`/`write`, a maturity tag (`smoke` for the few that gate CI, `regression` for the rest), and `migration-ready` once it's trusted. Use `intentional-change` and `legacy-bug-compatible` to mark deliberate deviations.

**Outputs:** a set of `*.yaml` scenarios per route; all validate with `bun run validate`.

**For the agent:** generate **small, focused** scenarios — one behavior each — rather than large scenarios that assert many things. A focused scenario produces a precise failure. Always generate both the success **and** the error/edge cases; a suite that only covers happy paths gives false confidence.

---

## 4. Stage 4 — Human Review Gate (mandatory)

**Goal:** a human validates the AI-generated design before it is trusted as a correctness gate or consumed by the proxy. This gate is **not optional** and does not disappear as confidence grows — what changes over time is how much scrutiny each item needs, not whether a human signs off.

**Inputs:** the drafted contract; the generated scenarios.

**Review checklist:**

*Contract:*
- [ ] Every `ignore_paths` / `unordered_arrays` / `sort_arrays` entry is **justified** and **narrow**. No broad subtree is ignored to make a test pass.
- [ ] No **meaningful** field is being normalized away (the over-normalization check).
- [ ] `redact_paths` covers everything sensitive; nothing secret can reach a log/diff/recording.
- [ ] Intentional differences are documented in `expectations.notes`.

*Scenarios:*
- [ ] Each scenario represents **real intended behavior**, not an accidental legacy quirk silently codified. Where a legacy bug is intentionally preserved, it's tagged `legacy-bug-compatible` with a reason.
- [ ] Success, error, and edge cases are present per route.
- [ ] Destructive scenarios are correctly marked and guarded with cleanup.
- [ ] Tags are correct, especially `smoke` (these will gate CI) and `intentional-change`.

*Design:*
- [ ] The chosen modes fit the routes (reads `compare_live`; writes handled per Section 6).
- [ ] The migration ordering is sane (low-risk first).

**Output:** an approved contract + scenario set, or change requests back to Stages 2–3. Only approved artifacts proceed.

**Why this gate exists:** the tools generate; humans validate. The entire safety argument rests on a person having confirmed that the tests encode the behavior the organization actually wants preserved, and that the normalization rules don't hide regressions. AI accelerates the drafting; it does not remove the need for judgment about what "correct" means.

---

## 5. Stage 5 — Refine to Green

**Goal:** converge the new service's behavior and the contract until the scenarios pass for the right reasons.

**Inputs:** approved contract + scenarios; a runnable legacy service and an in-progress new service (typically via Docker Compose; both pointed at the **same** datastore per the assumed pattern).

**The loop:**
1. Run the suite locally, focused on the route under work:
   ```bash
   bun run ftest -- run --scenario users.get-user-success
   # or a whole service by tag:
   bun run ftest -- run --include-tag migration-ready
   ```
2. For each failure, **diagnose which kind it is**:
   - **Real behavioral gap in the new service** → fix the new service. (This is the productive majority.)
   - **A legitimate dynamic difference not yet normalized** → add a *narrow* contract rule (and note why).
   - **An over-broad contract rule hiding something** → tighten the rule; the failure it now surfaces is real.
   - **A genuinely intended difference** → convert the scenario to assert the new behavior and tag `intentional-change`.
3. Re-run. Repeat until green.

**Convergence criteria (per route):**
- All required scenarios pass.
- Every normalization rule that was added during refinement has a recorded reason.
- No scenario is passing *only* because of an unjustified ignore rule.

**Outputs:** a green scenario set for the route; a contract whose rules are now **validated**, not just drafted. This validated contract is what Limen will consume in Stage 6 — unchanged.

**For the agent:** when a comparison fails, read the diff and classify it before acting. Resist the reflex to silence a failure by widening an ignore path — that is the failure mode the whole approach is designed to prevent. Prefer fixing the new service; normalize only genuinely incidental differences, narrowly.

**This is where the contract earns trust.** A contract that has survived Pharos refinement against real responses is materially more trustworthy than the AI's first draft — that's the entire point of doing functional validation *before* touching production traffic.

## 6. Reads vs. Writes — Different Playbooks

Reads and writes are handled **differently** throughout. This section is the reference; the stages above apply it.

### 6.1 Reads (GET/HEAD)

The straightforward, fully-supported path.

- **Pharos:** `compare_live` — call both, compare with the contract. Reads have no side effects on the shared store, so they are safe to run repeatedly and in any environment.
- **Limen:** `shadow_legacy_primary` — legacy serves the client; new is shadowed; responses compared live. This is the safe observation mode. Raise to `percentage_split` once parity and budgets are green.
- **Data consistency:** trivial under the shared-store pattern — both read the same data, so a passing response comparison *is* a consistency check.

### 6.2 Writes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)

Writes are **not shadowed by default** and are validated differently, because executing a write twice (once per implementation) against a shared store would double the side effect.

**Recommended path (a): validate writes via `new_only_assert` against controlled data.**
- Use Pharos `new_only_assert` to drive the new implementation's write and assert the response (status, returned resource shape, error envelopes) against explicit expectations derived from legacy behavior.
- Run against **seeded/controlled** test data so the write's effect is known and cleanable. Guard as `destructive` with `cleanup` hooks.
- Because the store is shared and the migration is a logic re-implementation, a write performed by the new service lands in the same place legacy would have put it — so asserting the response shape plus a read-back (below) gives high confidence.

**Advanced pattern (b): compare writes by reading back.**
- A multi-step scenario: perform the write through the new service, then **read the created/updated resource back** (via a GET that has *already* been validated as a read in 6.1) and compare that read against what legacy produces for the same resource.
- This validates that the new write produced a stored result indistinguishable from legacy's, using the already-trusted read path as the oracle. Mark `destructive`, seed and clean up.

**Out of scope (c): shadowing writes to an isolated store.** Running the write against both implementations with a separate store for "new" approaches dual-write and reconciliation, which both tools deliberately exclude. Do not attempt this as part of the standard runbook; if a migration truly needs it, it's a bespoke effort outside Pharos/Limen.

**Limen and writes:**
- Writes move via `percentage_split` (not shadow), so each request goes to exactly **one** implementation — no doubled side effect. Determinism by assignment key keeps a given tenant/user consistent.
- **Never auto-failover a non-idempotent write.** Limen's `failover_to_legacy` must not retry a POST on the new service after a failure unless the route is explicitly marked safe — a failed-but-applied write retried on legacy would double it. Idempotent writes (PUT/DELETE) can be configured for failover.

### 6.3 Routes with external side effects

A route marked `has-external-side-effects` (email, third-party call, payment, job enqueue) must **not** be shadowed even if it's an HTTP read, because the shadow would trigger the side effect a second time. Migrate these via `percentage_split` only, validate with `new_only_assert` against test doubles/sandboxes, and review with extra care.

### 6.4 Idempotency summary

| Method | Typical idempotency | Shadow? | Failover? |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET / HEAD | idempotent | yes (default) | yes |
| PUT | idempotent (typically) | no by default; opt-in possible, **with a recorded per-route idempotence analysis** | yes, if configured |
| PATCH | **not inherently idempotent** — `validate.rs`'s `NON_IDEMPOTENT_METHODS` lists it alongside `POST`, so a route-specific proof is required, not assumed | no by default; opt-in possible, **with a recorded per-route idempotence analysis** | **no** unless explicitly safe — a `failover_to_legacy` route carrying `PATCH` must set `failover_safe: true` after that analysis |
| DELETE | idempotent | **no — not eligible for shadowing at all** | yes, if configured |
| POST | non-idempotent | no by default; opt-in possible, **with a recorded per-route idempotence analysis** | **no** unless explicitly safe |
| POST-as-query (logical read, no writes) | idempotent | yes, if confirmed no side effects | yes |

### 6.5 Logical reads over POST, and opted-in writes over POST/PUT/PATCH

Some services use POST for complex queries that don't mutate state. If you can **confirm** (from code) that such a route is side-effect-free, it may be treated as a read for shadowing — but this requires explicit confirmation, not assumption, and should be noted in the route inventory.

Limen makes that confirmation explicit in config: the route opts the method in with `comparison.shadow_methods: ["POST"]` (also eligible: `PUT`, `PATCH`; `DELETE` deliberately is not — see the [config reference](https://charliek.github.io/limen/reference/config-reference/)). The request body is buffered within `max_body_bytes` and replayed byte-identically to both upstreams; a larger body streams to the primary and is not shadowed (`shadow_skipped{reason="request_too_large"}`). Nothing changes for routes that don't opt in.

Listing a method in Limen's allowlist only makes it *mechanically* eligible — it is not a safety proof for any given route. Before opting a route's write into `shadow_methods`, record a per-route idempotence analysis: name the mutation, state the response-visible effect of the shadow executing it a second time, and identify the corpus constraint (fixed key, idempotent upsert, response that doesn't expose ordering, etc.) that keeps that effect from surfacing. Treat the allowlist as a reminder that this analysis is owed, not as evidence it was done.

---

## 7. Data Consistency Validation

Under the assumed **shared-datastore** pattern, consistency validation is mostly about **response and behavioral parity over the same data** — which the contract and scenarios already deliver. This section makes the guarantees and the residual edges explicit.

### 7.1 What "consistent" means here

Because both implementations read and write the same store:
- **For reads:** identical stored data → responses must match (after normalization). A passing `compare_live` is a direct consistency check.
- **For writes:** a write through the new implementation must leave the store in the same state legacy would have. Validated via read-back (Section 6.2b).

### 7.2 Read-after-write across implementations

The shared store makes cross-implementation read-after-write meaningful and safe to test:
- Write via new (Pharos `new_only_assert` or a `percentage_split` request in Limen), then read via the **trusted** legacy-validated read path, and confirm the result matches legacy's representation. This catches new-write logic that stores subtly different data (wrong defaulting, dropped fields, format drift) even when the *write response* looked fine.

### 7.3 Drift checks during rollout

While a write route is split between implementations, periodically run the read-back consistency scenarios (Section 6.2b) against resources created by **each** implementation. Both populations should read back identically. Divergence is a signal to halt rollout (Section 8 gates).

### 7.4 The separate-store exception (caution)

If legacy and new do **not** share a store, none of the above holds cheaply: writes must be reconciled, read-after-write spans two stores, and drift is continuous. This is dual-write territory, explicitly outside Pharos/Limen. If you find yourself here, stop and design a dedicated data-migration/reconciliation approach; do not rely on this runbook's consistency guarantees.

---

## 8. Stages 6–7 — Shadow, then Roll Out (with Budgets)

This is where validation moves from deterministic testing to live traffic, and where two things together become the go/no-go gate: **`limen verdict`'s typed exit code** for parity and pipeline integrity, and the **latency + error-rate budget** for everything the proxy cannot judge on your behalf.

### 8.1 The budget (define before shadowing)

For each route, define a **budget** the route must satisfy to advance. The latency and error-rate rows are conventions the engineer maintains against Limen's exposed metrics and the service's own — nothing in Limen judges whether the new service is fast enough.

The parity row is different in kind, and the difference matters: [`limen verdict`](https://charliek.github.io/limen/reference/cli/#verdict) is **zero-tolerance**. It does not compare a mismatch *rate* against a threshold; any remaining non-canary mismatch is exit `10`. So read the parity row below as a **triage** target — how much unexplained divergence you tolerate while working a route toward the gate — and never as the gate itself, which is 8.3.

Default budget (tune per route/service):

| Dimension | Default gate to advance |
|---|---|
| **Response parity (shadow)** — *triage target, not the gate* | While working the route: unexplained mismatch rate **< 0.1%** of compared requests over the window, and **zero** unexplained mismatches in high-risk fields — the point at which reading every remaining diff individually is tractable. To *pass*, each remaining mismatch must be **resolved**: fixed in `new`, normalized by a narrow contract rule, or accepted as `intentional-change`. Any that survives all three is exit `10`. |
| **New-service error rate** | New 5xx rate **≤ legacy 5xx rate** for the same route over the window (new must not be worse). |
| **New-service latency** | New **p95 ≤ legacy p95** (or within a **documented exception**, e.g. "+15% p95 allowed because Z") for the route over the window. p99 not pathologically worse. |
| **Proxy overhead** | Limen's own added latency within its SLO (streaming p50 < 1 ms, p99 < 5 ms; buffer-for-compare p50 < 3 ms) — i.e. confirm the *proxy* is healthy, separately from the service. |

`comparison.min_comparisons` is **not** a budget row and does not belong in this table: it is an *exercise floor* — did this route get compared at all — read by `limen verdict` (and cross-checked against the verdict's floors by `limen report --format html`), and set from the traffic you expect rather than from a tolerance you accept.

A **migration exception** is a deliberate, documented allowance for a route to regress within a bound (e.g. a route that does more work in the new implementation by design). Record it next to the route; it changes the gate for that route only. There is no such thing as a parity exception expressed as a rate — an accepted difference is accepted *in the contract*, where it is reviewable, or it is a mismatch.

### 8.2 Stage 6 — Shadow

**Action:** wire the route into Limen as `shadow_legacy_primary` with the validated contract referenced, comparison enabled, and a sensible `sample_rate` for the route's volume.

```yaml
routes:
  - id: "get-user"
    match: { methods: ["GET"], path_prefix: "/users/" }
    legacy_upstream: "https://legacy.internal"
    new_upstream: "https://new.internal"
    mode: "shadow_legacy_primary"
    contract: "./contracts/user-service.contract.yaml#get-user"
    comparison:
      enabled: true
      sample_rate: 0.1
      max_body_bytes: 262144
      min_comparisons: 20        # the floor `limen verdict` holds this route to

diff_sink: { dir: "./campaign-diffs" }   # the durable mismatch trail
debug: { sink_canary: true }             # exposes POST /debug/canary
```

Three fields there are not about routing at all — they exist so the gate in 8.3 can be taken mechanically. Omit the last two and the gate cannot run at all; ignore the first and it runs against the default floor of `1`, which almost any traffic clears:

- **`comparison.min_comparisons`** (default `1`) — the floor this route must clear for a verdict to pass. Set it to a number the campaign's traffic should comfortably exceed; set it to `0`, deliberately and visibly, for a route this campaign's topology genuinely cannot exercise.
- **`diff_sink.dir`** (top level) — the durable JSONL trail. Reset it whenever the proxy under test starts; a sink carried across restarts makes the verdict's reconciliation fail, correctly.
- **`debug.sink_canary: true`** (top level) — exposes `POST /debug/canary`, without which `limen verdict --canary` is refused rather than silently skipped.

**Watch, on the dimensions the gate does not cover:** new-upstream latency and error metrics against legacy (the 8.1 budget rows the proxy cannot judge for you), and the two *separate* skip families —

- `limen_comparison_skipped_total{reason}`: a shadow was planned but the comparison did not happen. `response_too_large` (body over `max_body_bytes`), `event_stream` (the response declared `text/event-stream`, skipped by content type before a byte was buffered), `response_buffer_timeout` (buffering outlived what was left of the request's `primary_ms` — a trickling or stalled body, of declared length or not).
- `limen_shadow_skipped_total{reason}`: no shadow was dispatched at all. `concurrency_limit` (the shadow-concurrency cap was saturated) and `request_too_large` (a write-shadowing route's request body could not be buffered for replay).

A request the sampler never selected appears in **neither**: no shadow is planned, so there is nothing to record a skip against. Coverage is therefore arithmetic you do yourself — `sample_rate` against eligible request volume — not a metric to read off. A route whose comparisons are mostly skipped has a parity result resting on very little traffic. Read recurring mismatch diffs for *what* differs and feed them back as new Pharos scenarios (closing the loop), or accept them as `intentional-change`.

Clients have been served **only** legacy this entire time, and the shadow leg is fire-and-forget off the client path, so it carries no user-facing risk. The **sampled comparison** is not quite free, and it is worth being honest about the two costs it does put on the client path: buffering the primary response to compare it delays the client's first byte (bounded by `primary_ms`, then demoted to streaming — see [resilience & failover](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/resilience/#timeouts)), and a primary body that errors *while* it is being buffered is returned as Limen's own `502` rather than as a truncated stream. Both fall only on the sampled fraction, and bounding them is exactly what `sample_rate` and that deadline are for. What shadow mode never risks is sending a client to `new`.

The remaining risk in this stage is proving nothing at all, which is what 8.3 exists to rule out.

### 8.3 The shadow gate — `limen verdict`, not a reading of the counters

"Zero mismatches" is not a gate. It is satisfied equally well by *compared everything, found nothing*, by *compared nothing*, and by *compared plenty while the recording pipeline silently dropped every record*. The gate to leave Stage 6 is therefore a command with a typed exit code, not an operator's reading of a metrics page:

```bash
limen verdict -c campaign.config.yaml --canary --format json > verdict.json
```

In one invocation `verdict` waits for the shadow/comparison/sink pipeline to quiesce (observed, never slept), asserts every floored route compared at least its configured minimum, reconciles the sink's per-route counts against the engine's own counters, drives the canary through the real compare → observer → sink → flush path, and counts non-canary mismatches. Every check fails closed: an input it could not read is never scored as "0 mismatches."

| Exit | Meaning | The gate's response |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Drained, floors met, sink integral, zero non-canary mismatches. | Advance — subject to the latency/error rows of 8.1, which `verdict` does not judge. |
| `10` | Mismatches found. | Triage each one: real divergence → fix `new`; incidental → a narrow contract rule; intended → `intentional-change`. |
| `20` | Floors unmet: a route below its floor (**starved**), or at its floor with sampled work that went uncompared — a skip of any reason, or a shadow that never answered (**undermined**) — or a config that floors nothing at all. | **Not** a parity result, and the two causes take different medicine. Starved: extend the traffic corpus (or fix the config) — the run proved nothing about that route. Undermined: read the verdict's remedy line for the named reason (raise `max_body_bytes`, raise `server.shadow_concurrency_limit` or lower drive concurrency, raise `timeouts.primary_ms`, or — for `event_stream` — unfloor the route and relay it instead), change that one knob, **restart limen, and re-drive the floors**. A shadow failure (`timeout`/`error`) is a finding about `new`, not about limen's tooling — read its logs before re-running. The counters behind this check are cumulative for the process's life, so re-running `verdict` alone against the same process stays `20`. |
| `30` | Sink integrity: dropped sink records, unparseable sink lines, counter routes this config does not know, per-route disagreement between sink and engine — or, with `--canary`, a canary that never landed or one on which sink and engine disagree. | Stop. Trust none of the numbers in this run until the sink is understood. |
| `40` | Drain timeout — the pipeline never quiesced. | Re-run with traffic actually stopped; the mismatch and floor numbers from a run that never drained are unreliable, which is why `40` outranks `10` and `20`. |
| `50` | A required input was unavailable (control plane unreachable, sink unreadable, a required metric series absent, a refused canary trigger). | A refused verdict, not a failed one. Fix the invocation. |

The disciplines behind those codes are set out in full in [prove your lens bites](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/prove-your-lens-bites/) — read it once before the first campaign rather than deriving them from the exit table. Two of them decide whether a clean exit means anything:

- **Floors prove something was compared, and "compared" now means something stricter than "reached the comparison engine."** An *unsampled* request is a `sample_rate` decision made before the campaign runs — it appears in no floor at all, and coverage in that sense stays arithmetic you do yourself, traffic volume against `sample_rate`, not a metric to read off. A *sampled* request that was not compared is a different thing entirely: it is a skip (`response_too_large`, `request_too_large`, `concurrency_limit`, `response_buffer_timeout`, `event_stream`) or a shadow failure (`timeout`, `error`), and every one of them now fails the floor of the route it happened on — even once that route's raw comparison count clears `min_comparisons`. A shadow failure is a finding about `new`, not about limen's tooling; read its logs before re-running. `min_comparisons: 20` is still met by 20 comparisons out of 20 eligible requests exactly as by 20 out of 20,000 — what changed is that those 20 must themselves be 20 the pipeline actually finished, not 20 out of 23 where three quietly went uncompared.
- **The canary proves the recording pipeline is live.** A campaign with real mismatches would eventually notice a broken sink; a campaign with zero real mismatches never would, because an empty sink and a correctly empty sink render identically. Run `--canary` in *every* campaign wrapper — a standing check that only runs when someone remembers is not a standing check. Note what it does not prove: it goes through no route's comparison rules and says nothing about whether any real shadow request was dispatched. Floors plus real traffic cover that half; the two are complementary, not redundant.

Periodically — when the contract vocabulary changes materially, not every run — falsify the gate: mutate the config or the sink in a way with one predicted effect on the exit code, confirm the prediction, and revert. A gate nobody has ever seen fail is a gate nobody has tested.

**The campaign bundle.** Take the verdict *first*, then render the human-facing page from the artifacts it left behind, so the page can never disagree with the gate:

```bash
limen verdict -c campaign.config.yaml --canary --format json > verdict.json \
  && verdict_exit=0 || verdict_exit=$?

# Both captures are OPTIONAL inputs, and each flag is passed only if its capture
# actually produced content. An empty or truncated file is "provided but
# unparseable" — a FAILURE on the page — which is strictly worse than not
# passing the flag at all. (`/observe/profile` 404s unless the campaign config
# carries an `observe:` block, so `curl -f` is doing real work here.)
# 127.0.0.1:9090 below is this runbook's example `metrics.listen_addr`; substitute
# your campaign config's control-plane address and metrics path throughout.
page_flags=()
if curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:9090/observe/profile > profile.json && [ -s profile.json ]; then
  page_flags+=(--profile profile.json)
fi
if curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics > metrics.txt && [ -s metrics.txt ]; then
  page_flags+=(--metrics metrics.txt)
fi

limen report --dir ./campaign-diffs \
  --verdict verdict.json \
  --config  campaign.config.yaml \
  "${page_flags[@]}" \
  --format html --out status.html

exit "$verdict_exit"
```

`status.html` is one self-contained page — no JavaScript, no external fetches, readable from `file://` and postable as a CI artifact — answering "what is covered, and what is switched over" from those artifacts alone. It cross-checks them rather than trusting them: sink counts against the verdict's per-route map, verdict floors against the config's effective floors, every route id against the config's route table. A missing input renders as *not provided* and downgrades the banner to INCOMPLETE; an input that was provided but could not be read or parsed is a FAILURE — which is why the snippet passes `--profile`/`--metrics` only when the capture succeeded, since an empty file is provided-but-unparseable, not absent; a disagreement between two artifacts is a named drift finding and a FAILURE. The banner is CLEAN only when the sink, the verdict, and the config are all present and parsed, the verdict is online and exit-`0`, every input that *was* provided parsed, and no cross-check drifted — and an empty sink directory is INCOMPLETE, never clean, since sink files are created on the first mismatch and their absence is indistinguishable from a pipeline that never ran.

**The page is not the gate.** `limen report --format html` exits `0` whenever the page was produced — including a page that is nothing but failures, because a CI artifact that vanishes on a bad run is one nobody looks at. `limen verdict`'s exit code is the gate; the page is how a human reads the campaign afterward.

**Gate to proceed:** `limen verdict --canary` exits `0` **and** the latency/error rows of the budget (8.1) are green over a meaningful observation window, with every recurring mismatch resolved or explained.

### 8.4 Stage 7 — Percentage rollout

**Action:** move the route to `percentage_split` and raise the rollout flag in steps, **pausing at each step** to recheck the budget against *real* traffic now hitting the new service:

```
0%  →  1%  →  5%  →  25%  →  50%  →  100%
```

This ladder is tested doctrine, not a prescription taken on faith: it is the procedure the [rollout simulation](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/flags-and-rollout/#tuning) ran live, 2026-08-16, against two real backends (Python legacy, Rust new) behind a real limen process, driving 1000 keyed clients through two passes per route at every rung. Each stage's verdict checked record completeness, the validity guard, exact stage ends, exact central-binomial bounds on the observed split, two-pass stickiness (a key's side never flips within a stage), and monotone nesting of the new-side key set — raising the flag only ever *adds* keys, which is exact arithmetic for a fixed key set under the deterministic `blake3` bucketing (spec §6.4), not a statistical tendency. Flag flips propagated end-to-end in ~580ms against the file provider's 500ms poll, measured from the [resolved-target gauge](#10-monitoring-validating-the-proxy-itself), not assumed.

```yaml
routes:
  - id: "get-user"
    mode: "percentage_split"
    rollout:
      percentage_flag: "migration.get-user.rollout_percentage"
      default_percentage: 0
      assignment_key: { header: "x-tenant-id", fallback: "request_random" }
    # optionally keep shadowing the non-primary side to continue comparing
```

Raise the flag at runtime (no redeploy) via the flag provider. After each increase:
- Recheck the budget (8.1) on the now-live new traffic.
- For write routes, run the read-back drift check (7.3).
- Watch `limen_rollout_resolved_target_percentage{route}` confirm the flag actually took. It is the flag-resolved **target**, deliberately not the effective share — an open breaker doesn't move it — and a stale-flag fail-safe reads `0` here (with the staleness gauges saying why) even while the flag file still claims otherwise.
- Only advance when green; otherwise **hold or roll back** (8.5).

### 8.5 Rollback / abort criteria (named, automatic where possible)

Roll back **immediately** if any of the following, during shadow or rollout:

- New-service **error rate** exceeds the budget → Limen's **circuit breaker** opens automatically and returns traffic to legacy; investigate before re-enabling.
- New-service **latency** breaches the budget (and no exception covers it) → **lower the rollout flag** to the last-green percentage.
- **Parity** regresses (mismatch rate climbs, or a high-risk-field mismatch appears) → lower the flag; reproduce as a Pharos scenario; fix; re-refine.
- **Data drift** appears in read-back checks → halt rollout at the current percentage; do not advance until resolved.

Rollback mechanisms, in order of automaticity:
1. **Circuit breaker** (automatic, per Limen config) — covers error/timeout spikes with no human action.
2. **Lower the rollout flag** (manual, instant, no redeploy) — the primary deliberate rollback lever.
3. **Set the route to `legacy_only`** (config change) — full stop for that route.

Because traffic shifting is flag-driven, rollback is **fast and reversible** — a core safety property of the approach, and one the [rollout simulation](https://charliek.github.io/limen/guides/flags-and-rollout/#tuning) exercised on all three tiers rather than assumed. Killing the new backend mid-ladder (at 50%) opened the breaker on every split route — `limen_breaker_transitions_total` recording each closed→open — while `failover_safe` routes kept serving `200`s throughout via client-invisible replay and the non-`failover_safe` routes failed **visibly** (limen-synthesized `502`/`504`, no replay, confirmed independently by the legacy access log carrying none of their request nonces): invariant 4's two arms, each attested on its own evidence. Restarting the backend walked the breaker open→half_open→closed per route — read off the transition counters *before* anyone compared key sets — and the recovered 50% population equaled the pre-kill one exactly. Lowering the flag from 50% back to 5% returned **exactly** the earlier 5% key set: rollback lands you on the identical population you started from, not a merely similarly-sized one, and it does so in about the same ~580ms it takes a flag to propagate at all (8.4).

**Residuals.** All of the above was one limen process on one host, in front of one pair of real backends, under a synthetic keyed workload rather than an organic traffic mix, with no load balancer or fleet of proxies in front to skew flag propagation. The drills prove the mechanisms; they don't stand in for production topology.

## 9. Cross-Framework Difference Catalog

A generic lookup table mapping the **common ways two HTTP/JSON implementations differ for incidental reasons** to the contract rule that handles each. Use it in Stage 2 (drafting) and Stage 5 (refining). It is framework-agnostic by design — these patterns recur across most stack changes.

| Difference pattern | Why it happens | Contract handling | Caution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JSON object key order** | Different serializers emit keys in different orders | Handled automatically by `json_semantic` / canonical key sort — **no rule needed** | — |
| **Timestamp precision** (millis vs. seconds) | Framework default time formatting differs | `normalize_timestamps` at the coarser precision | Don't over-coarsen and hide a real time bug |
| **Timestamp zone format** (`Z` vs. `+00:00`) | Library formatting choice | `normalize_timestamps` (normalize representation) | — |
| **Generated IDs / UUIDs** | New resource IDs differ per request | `ignore_paths` on the ID **when the test doesn't pin it**; otherwise extract and reuse | Ignoring an ID you should be asserting hides identity bugs |
| **Request/trace/correlation IDs** | Per-request, non-deterministic | `ignore_paths` (or redact if sensitive) | — |
| **Array ordering** (incidental) | Different query/iteration order over the same data | `sort_arrays` by a stable key | Only if order is genuinely non-contractual |
| **Array as set** | Order truly meaningless (e.g. permissions) | `unordered_arrays` | Confirm order isn't part of the contract |
| **Enum casing/spelling** (`ACTIVE` vs `enabled`) | Re-implementation chose different tokens | `enum_aliases` | Document the mapping; ensure it's intended, not a typo |
| **Null vs. absent field** | Frameworks differ on emitting `null` vs. omitting | Decide the contract: assert the intended one; normalize the other only if the difference is agreed-incidental | This is often a **real** API contract question — don't paper over it reflexively |
| **Number formatting** (`1.0` vs `1`, trailing zeros) | Serializer numeric handling | Normalize only if semantically equal and agreed incidental | Precision changes can be real |
| **Error envelope shape** (`{error:{code,message}}` vs `{message}`) | Frameworks have different default error formats | Assert the **intended** envelope explicitly (`subset`/`explicit_expectations`); if the new shape is intended, tag `intentional-change` | Error contracts matter to clients — be deliberate |
| **Default/missing pagination fields** | Framework defaults differ | Assert intended pagination contract; normalize only incidental metadata | — |
| **Header casing / volatile headers** (`Date`, `X-Request-Id`) | Per-response, non-contractual | Compare headers only when listed; ignore volatile ones | — |
| **Whitespace / content-type charset** (`application/json` vs `; charset=utf-8`) | Framework defaults | Normalize/ignore if incidental | — |

**Rule of thumb for the catalog:** the left column is *incidental representation*; the right column makes it disappear **narrowly**. Anything that might be a real API-contract decision (null-vs-absent, error envelopes, number precision) is flagged "caution" because the correct move is often to **assert the intended behavior**, not to normalize the difference away.

---

## 10. Monitoring & Validating the Proxy Itself

Distinct from validating the service: you must also confirm **Limen** is behaving correctly, so that a "green" reading reflects reality.

**Confirm the proxy is healthy (separately from the service):**
- **Proxy overhead within SLO.** Limen's added latency on the streaming path (p50 < 1 ms, p99 < 5 ms) and buffer-for-compare path (p50 < 3 ms) — from Limen's own latency metrics, isolating proxy time from upstream time. If proxy overhead is out of band, a latency reading attributed to the new service may actually be the proxy.
- **Shadow truly off the client path.** Client-visible latency must be unchanged whether shadowing is on or off (Limen guarantees this architecturally; verify it in staging by toggling shadow and watching client latency).
- **Comparison coverage.** Watch `limen_comparison_skipped_total` by reason — `response_too_large`, `event_stream` (the response declared `text/event-stream`, so it is skipped by content type before any buffering), `response_buffer_timeout` (buffering outlived what was left of the request's `primary_ms`; a slow body hits this whether or not it declared a `Content-Length`) — and, separately, `limen_shadow_skipped_total`'s `concurrency_limit` / `request_too_large`, where no shadow was dispatched at all. If most eligible traffic lands in these, your parity result rests on too little data: raise `max_body_bytes` for the first reason, but note the other two are deadline- and content-type-driven and will not move. Remember that an unsampled request is recorded in neither family — coverage is `sample_rate` against eligible volume, computed by you, not a metric to read.
- **Flag health.** Provider health and staleness metrics green — a stale flag provider means rollout decisions may be running on the fail-safe (legacy), which is safe but means your "rollout" isn't actually happening.
- **Rollout target.** `limen_rollout_resolved_target_percentage{route}` is the flag-resolved percentage a `percentage_split` route is scraped at — deliberately the *target*, not the effective share (an open breaker doesn't move it). Stale flags resolve it to `0`, with the staleness gauges above saying why; use it to confirm a flag change actually took before trusting anything downstream of it.
- **Circuit-breaker state.** Know whether a breaker is open; an open breaker silently routing to legacy can masquerade as "new service has no traffic / no errors." `limen_breaker_transitions_total{route,from,to}` counts every state change (closed↔open↔half_open) alongside the sampled state gauge, so a breaker that flapped between two scrapes is visible in the counters even when the gauge caught it in either state.

**Two-part latency obligation, restated:**
1. **The proxy adds acceptable overhead** (proxy health) — Limen SLO.
2. **The new service meets or beats legacy latency per route** (or within a documented exception) — the budget in Section 8.1.

Both must be true to call a route green. Conflating them is a common mistake: a fast proxy in front of a slow new service is not a green route, and a slow proxy can make a fast new service look bad.

## 11. Stage 8 — Cut Over and Regression

**Goal:** complete the migration and retain ongoing protection.

**Actions:**
- At 100% and stable, choose the end state:
  - **`failover_to_legacy`** — new is primary, legacy remains a safety net. Safest if legacy is still running and cheap to keep.
  - **`new_only`** — once legacy is decommissioned. No fallback; only after sustained confidence.
- **Keep the Pharos scenarios** as a **regression suite**. They run in CI for the new service indefinitely, in local/staging/CI, catching future regressions. The validated contract remains the comparison reference.
- Feed any **post-cutover** issues back as new scenarios.

**Outputs:** a migrated route at 100%, a documented end-state mode, and a living regression suite.

## 13. Notes for Skill Authoring

This runbook is structured so a skill can be derived from it. The skill's job, given a service's code + OpenAPI + samples, is to **produce the artifacts** the runbook's early stages call for and to guide the later stages. Maintain these mappings when authoring the skill:

- **Discover → a route-inventory generator.** Input: OpenAPI + router code. Output: the classified inventory table (Section 1).
- **Observe → an evidence gatherer, not a decider.** Input: a profiled proxy (or a saved profile document). Output: `limen suggest-routes`' per-route disposition and evidence merged into the inventory (Section 1b), with every `compare_candidate` still flagged for a human to confirm against the handler's source. The skill must never emit `--adopt-suggestions`, and must read exit `20` as "this draft rests on no evidence" — the document is still written, so its existence is not the signal.
- **Draft → a contract generator.** Input: inventory + samples + serialization code. Output: a `*.contract.yaml` using the catalog (Section 9) to choose rules. Bias: narrowest rules; everything else is a real assertion.
- **Generate → a scenario generator.** Input: inventory + contract + OpenAPI responses. Output: the standard scenario family per route (Section 3), small and focused, success + error + edge.
- **Review → a checklist surfacer.** The skill **presents** the Stage 4 checklist for a human; it does not self-approve.
- **Refine → a failure classifier.** Given a Pharos diff, classify it (real gap / legitimate-dynamic / over-broad-rule / intended-change) and recommend the corresponding action (Section 5), defaulting to "fix the new service," never to "widen the ignore path."
- **Shadow/Roll out → a gate evaluator.** Run `limen verdict --canary --format json` and branch on its typed exit code (Section 8.3) rather than parsing prose or scraping counters; add the latency/error rows of the budget (Section 8.1), which the verdict does not judge; recommend advance / hold / roll back per Section 8.5. Render `limen report --format html` as the artifact a human reads afterward — never as the gate.

The invariant the skill must preserve end to end: **the tools generate and recommend; a human validates intent and correctness.** Every normalization rule and every trusted scenario passes through human judgment before it gates anything or reaches production traffic.
